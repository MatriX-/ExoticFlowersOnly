## Codebase Analysis

### Current State
- **Project Structure**: Minimal codebase with only an empty `main.py` file
- **Technology Stack**: Python-based project (inferred from main.py)
- **Dependencies**: No package.json, requirements.txt, or other dependency files found
- **Google Sheets Integration**: No existing Google Sheets integration found

### Technical Requirements Identified
- Need to implement Google Sheets API integration from scratch
- Will require Google Sheets API credentials and authentication
- Need to implement:
  - Sheet copying functionality 
  - Column deletion (A, F, G)
  - Menu/interface system
  - Authentication handling

### Recommended Approach
- Use Google Sheets API v4 with Python client library (`google-api-python-client`)
- Implement OAuth2 authentication for user access
- Create a command-line or web-based menu interface
- Structure the application with proper separation of concerns

### Integration Points
- This appears to be a greenfield project requiring full implementation
- No existing patterns or conventions to follow
- Full flexibility in architecture and technology choices
